Allows MailPoet users to easily unsubscribe or delete newsletter subscribers who have bounced, rejected, reported you for spam and more. This will help keep your Mandrill reputation as high as possible by cleaning up errors. Works with MailPoet (formerly Wysija).


== Description ==

If you use the MandrillApp service to send your MailPoet (formerly Wysija) newsletter emails, then this is a great add-on for you. In order to keep your Mandrill reputation high (which affects your rate limit for sending) you must be sure that Mandrill bounces, spam complaints, and unsubscribes are wiped from your newsletter.

MailPoet will not receive spam complaints that were sent to Mandrill so it's best to get ALL of the spam complaints out of your newsletter before your Mandrill reputation drops.

MailPoet Mandrill Spam and Bounce Cleaner allows you remove all of the errors, bounces, rejections, spam complaints, unsubscribes from your newsletter list. It also allows you to compare the bounces, unsubscribes between MailPoet and the Mandrill API for reconciliation purposes.

= Features =

* Gather error list from Mandrill API of: soft bounce emails, hard bounce emails, rejected emails, spam complaint emails, and unsubscribe emails
* Delete / Unsubscribe soft bounces, hard bounces, reject, spam complaints, and unsubscribe emails from the Mandrill API
